# Portfolio
👋🏻 Hi there, thanks for your interest, and welcome to my portfolio!

Apps I worked on, ordered by timeline:
* [武財神 God of Wealth](#武財神)
  - The app, GodOfWealth, aims to connect users with local temples and facilitate spiritual activities. Users can seek divine guidance through fortune-telling, virtually worship deities, make prayers, and access an lunar calendar. A portion of the proceeds from the app is donated to charitable organizations. Embrace the synergy of technology and spirituality for a convenient and meaningful divine connection.

* [租屋雷達 Rent Radar](#租屋雷達)
  - "Rent Radar" is a rental property search engine designed specifically for tenants. It constantly scans major rental websites such as [591租屋網](https://www.591.com.tw), [樂屋網](https://www.rakuya.com.tw), and [好房網](https://www.housefun.com.tw), allowing you to find a place to rent with just one app. By setting your rental preferences as a radar, it will notify you of the latest available properties, offering a new experience of "passive house hunting."
