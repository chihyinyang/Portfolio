<!-- 會計小兔 info start -->
<img src="images/deco/accountantRabbit_banner.png" id="accountant-rabbit" max-height="40" max-width="484">

- **Chinese name**: 會計小兔
- **Overview**: Accountant Rabbit, a LINE chatbot, records daily spending on Google Sheets via text input.
- **Inspiration**: 
I share an flat with a roommate, and we frequently go grocery shopping together and cook meals or dine out as a team. However, keeping track of our expenses and settling bills has become a hassle. Since we both use LINE as our primary messaging platform, I thought of leveraging its functionality to streamline the process. My idea is to develop a Line-based solution where we can instantly log our expenses after each purchase, and conveniently access our transaction history using Google Sheets. This way, we can effortlessly manage and track our shared expenses.
- [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRSM1woMzidByCOn2qTZEWiQyyJZ1HZU/view)

  - Language: JavaScript

<!-- 口說記帳 info start -->

Simply open your phone and describe your expenses to Siri. Through speech recognition, Siri converts your spoken words into text and uses AI to extract details such as time, location, itemized expenses, and amounts. All this information is seamlessly recorded in your phone, allowing for effortless expense tracking and budgeting.
- **Inspiration**: Managing personal finances has always been a struggle for me since I started earning money. Despite my best efforts, I have failed to establish a consistent habit of tracking my expenses. That's why I have made the decision to create a tool that eliminates any excuses for not keeping up with my finances. With this tool, I am determined to put an end to my previous failures in expense tracking.
- **Technique**:
    - Speech ✅
    - Siri Kit (working on...)
